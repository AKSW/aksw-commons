## AKSW Commons

A utility collection for:

* Beans: An API to wrap an entity and declare custom getters, setters, annotations, constructors. For example, if a wrapped class does not expose a no-arg ctor, then the model allows for providing a lambda that can be used instead.
* Parallelizable Aggregators: Static builder pattern for parallelizable and serializable aggregators that work with java8+ streamn and apache spark.
* Collection utilities (not covered by guava / commons-collections4)
